# Practical 5
## _Write a Program to read the element of the given two matrixes & to perform the matrix multiplication._

### Description
- This program is used to find product of two matrices and print the resultant matrix.
- This program is flexible for matrix diffrent order of matrices but folowing the fundamental rule of matrix multiplication.
- Order of matrices `(m x n)  (p x q)`, Program checks wheather `n` equals to `p` if not then program terminates.  
 
### Issuses
- No Issues

### Output
Testing the Code:
```
Enter number row & column of first matrix: 2 3
Enter Elements of first matrix: 
1 2 3
4 5 6
Enter number row & column of second matrix: 3 2
Enter Elements of second matrix: 
7 8
9 10
11 12

Resultant matrix
