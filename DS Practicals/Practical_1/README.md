# Practical 1
## _Write a program to perform following operations in one dimensional array, Insertion, Deletion and Searching (Linear & Binary)._

### Description
- This program is a Menu driven Program with Five choices to selects.
- This program shows Array data structure implementaion.
- There are manny functions define to perform operation on Array such as Insertion, Deletion and Searching.
- There are two options for Searching Linear Search and Binary Search.
- Sorted Input is allowed for proper functioning of Program.
- Integer's are only accepted.
 
### Issuses
- While Insertion make sure Number added is in sorted form(Asceding Order).
- Unsorted Input may make Binary Search get unexpected Results. 

### Output
Performing INSERTION Operation 
```
1. INSERTION
2. DELETION
3. SEARCHING(Linear)
4. SEARCHING(Binary)
5. EXIT
Enter any choice: 1

Enter number to be inserted: 67
``` 
Performing DELETION operation
```
1. INSERTION
2. DELETION
3. SEARCHING(Linear)
4. SEARCHING(Binary)
5. EXIT
Enter any choice: 2

Enter number to be deleted: 67
``` 
Perfroming Linear Search Operation
```
1. INSERTION 
2. DELETION
3. SEARCHING(Linear)
4. SEARCHING(Binary)
5. EXIT
Enter any choice: 3

Enter number to be Searched: 67

Element found at index 0
```
Perfroming Binary Search Operation
```
1. INSERTION 
2. DELETION
3. SEARCHING(Linear)
4. SEARCHING(Binary)
5. EXIT
Enter any choice: 4

Enter number to be Searched: 90

Element found at index 1
```
Exiting from Program
```
1. INSERTION
2. DELETION
3. SEARCHING(Linear)
4. SEARCHING(Binary)
5. EXIT
Enter any choice: 5

Program is Exiting...
