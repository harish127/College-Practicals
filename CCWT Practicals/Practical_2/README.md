# Practical 2
## _ To Develop and demonstrate a XHTML file that includes JavaScript script for the following problems: 
       a) Input: A number n obtained using prompt, Output: The first n Fibonacci numbers
       b) Input: A number n obtained using prompt, Output: A table of numbers from 1 to n and their squares using alert _

### Description
- There are Two buttons one for fibonacci and other for table and square 
- Added a <h1> for heading.
- Added <label> for each button for description. 
- In javascript added a test for non-numeric value if so it will alert. 
### Issues
- I think there is nothing worng in HTML CSS, everyone have his prospective.
