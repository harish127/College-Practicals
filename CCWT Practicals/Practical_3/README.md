# Practical 3
## _To Develop and demonstrate a XHTML file that includes Javascript script that uses functions for the following problems:
  a) Parameter: A string, Output: The position in the string of the left-most vowel
  b) Parameter: A number, Output: The number with its digits in the reverse order_

### Description
- There are Two buttons one for left-most vowel and other for digit reverse of number. 
- Added a h1 tag for heading.
- Added label tag for each button for description. 
### Issues
- I think there is nothing worng in HTML CSS, everyone have his prospective.
- digit reverse not only works for number but also for alfanumeric type values.
